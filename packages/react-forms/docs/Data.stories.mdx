# Data flow

The form configuration expects a submit function, and can also be provided with initial data to fill the form fields.

### Submit function

The submit function's behaviour is totally up to the caller choice. The only constraint is it must be an asynchronous function which takes as a parameter the values of the form at the time of submission.

```
{
  onSubmit: async (values) => { console.log(values); }
}
```

### Initial values

The `values` property allows the caller to specify initial values for some of the fields (for instance when the form is used to edit a record).

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-form--initial-values" />
</Canvas>


### React to changes

You can provide a `onChange` function to the form renderer, to be notified of the internal values of the form without waiting for the submission.

```
{
  onChange: (values) => { console.log(values); }
}
```
