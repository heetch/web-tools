# CSS

Although this library takes a very opinionated approach about rendering the form and handling its layout on screen, it tries to stay opened to customization.
That is why specific CSS classes are exposed at all levels of the form, so that you can write custom CSS on top of it.

## At form level

Four classes are exposed for the form itself and its layout:

- `rf-form` on the form component itself
- `rf-submit` on the submit button
- `rf-layout-row` on each row of the form's layout
- `rf-layout-cell` on each cell within a row

## At field level

Each field type exposes classes on its component itself, and on inner parts for some of them.

### Boolean fields

All boolean fields have the `rf-field-boolean` class, and another class depending on their format: either `rf-field-boolean-checkbox` or `rf-field-boolean-toggle`.

### Date fields

All date fields have the `rf-field-date` class, and the ones with a `date-time` format also have the `rf-field-date-datetime` class.

### File fields

The file fields themselves have the `rf-field-file` class. Inner parts expose other classes:

- The list of files currently selected has the `rf-field-file-list` class
- Each file in the files list has the `rf-field-file-item` class
- The wrapper element around the `<input>` element (which is hidden) and the _Add_ button has the `rf-field-file-input-wrapper` class
- The hidden `<input>` element has the `rf-field-file-input` class
- The _Add_ button has the `rf-field-file-add-btn` class

### Number fields

Number fields have the `rf-field-number` class.

### String fields

All string fields have the `rf-field-string` class, and another class depending on their format: either `rf-field-string-line`, `rf-field-string-text` or `rf-field-string-select`.
